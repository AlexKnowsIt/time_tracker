# Time Tracker to boost Productivity

## Overview

This is a currently developed Django project that aims to provide simple input of multiple user data and shows them inside an Javascript Dashboard to the specific user.
Our current focus is on implementing the data science behind the output of the dashboard before we want to enable a REST API and a Shell Script to submit directly to the server.
